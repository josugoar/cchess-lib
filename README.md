**cchess-lib** is a fully featured chess library translated from the **gnome-chess** source code written in **vala** to **java**. It features a chess API as similar to **gnome-chess** as possible with some native workarounds over **vala** specific features.

**cchess-lib** is successfully implemented at its best in [**cches**](https://github.com/CoronaCrew/cchess), a Swing/AWT Java GUI desktop application also inspired by the **gnome-chess** frontend.
